# DoodleBug-ConsoleApp

Doodle Bug is an object oriented programming project that prints out the 'maze' to the console.
The idea of the game is that there are organisms which can be either doodlebugs or ants and these organisms need to meet certain requirements to eat, reproduce or starve. Which happens with each turn.
